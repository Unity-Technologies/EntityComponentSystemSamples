# Burst compiler

Burst is a new [LLVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM) based backend compiler technology that makes things easier for you. It takes C# jobs and produces highly-optimized machine code taking advantage of the particular capabilities of your platform. So you get a lot of the benefits of hand tuned assembler code, across multiple platforms, without all the hard work. The Burst compiler can be used to increase performance of jobs written for the [C# Job System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/JobSystem.html).
