## Multicore

General computing term.

> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor): "A multi-core processor is a single computing component with two or more independent processing units called cores, which read and execute program instructions. The instructions are ordinary CPU instructions... but the single processor can run multiple instructions on separate cores at the same time, increasing overall speed for programs amenable to parallel computing."
