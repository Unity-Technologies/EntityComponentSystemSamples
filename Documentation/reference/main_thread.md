# Main thread

General computing term.

> [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/main-thread-java/): "When a ...program starts up, one thread begins running immediately. This is usually called the **main** thread of our program, because it is the one that is executed when our program begins.

> - Often, it must be the last thread to finish execution because it performs various shutdown actions."

Many programming languages have a Main method that is the starting point of an application. The main thread will find this method and invoke it. Your program will run on the main thread unless you create additional threads yourself. For more information, see [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17669159/what-is-the-relation-between-the-main-method-and-main-thread-in-java). 

>  Note: In ECS we aim to remove as much code as possible out of the main thread and into jobs.
