## What does it show?

The scene contains three spheres which use the URP Lit, URP Unlit, and Shader Graph PBR output.

The material override authoring components attached to the MeshRenderers of the spheres override values for the the spheres' colors.

## How to use this sample scene?

1. In the Hierarchy, select the Subscene
2. In the Inspector, click Open
3. In the Hierarchy, select the **LitRed** or **UnlitRed** sphere

5. In the Hierarchy, select **PBRBlue** sphere
6. In the Inspector, note that there is Material Color component. If you want to override other custom Shader Graph material properties, you can reference the MaterialColor script and create one for each of your custom material properties
7. Click **Edit** to edit the Shader Graph, note that the Node Settings of the Color property has the Hybrid Instanced property enabled
