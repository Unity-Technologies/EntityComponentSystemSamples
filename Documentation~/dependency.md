# Dependency

General computing term. Also known as coupling.

> [Jenkov](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/ood/understanding-dependencies.html): "Whenever a class **A** uses another class… **B**, then **A** depends on **B**. **A** cannot carry out it's work without **B**, and **A** cannot be reused without also reusing **B**. In such a situation the class **A** is called the 'dependant' and the class… **B** is called the 'dependency'. A dependant depends on its dependencies."
