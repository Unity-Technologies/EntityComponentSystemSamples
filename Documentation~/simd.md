# SIMD

General computing term. SIMD stands for "Single Instruction Multiple Data". 

> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD): "SIMD… describes computers with multiple processing elements that perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously. Thus, such machines exploit [data level parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_parallelism), but not [concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing): there are simultaneous (parallel) computations, but only a single process (instruction) at a given moment… In other words, if the SIMD system works by loading up eight data points at once, the `add` operation being applied to the data will happen to all eight values at the same time.
