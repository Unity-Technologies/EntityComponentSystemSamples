# innerloopBatchCount

WIP

> [Unity Scripting API](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Jobs.IJobParallelForExtensions.Schedule.html): "innerloopBatchCount: Granularity in which workstealing is performed. A value of 32, means the job queue will steal 32 iterations and then perform them in an efficient inner loop."
