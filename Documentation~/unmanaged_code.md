# Unmanaged code 

General computing term. Also known as native code.

> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_code): "...Unmanaged code refers to programs written in C, C++, and other languages that do not need a [common language] runtime [virtual machine] to execute."

> [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/855756/difference-between-native-and-managed-code?answertab=votes#tab-top): "Native code is the code whose memory is not 'managed', as in, memory isn't freed for you (C++' delete and C's free, for instance), no [reference counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting), no [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science))."
