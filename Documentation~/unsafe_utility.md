# UnsafeUtility

> [Unity Scripting API](https://docs.unity3d.com/es/2018.1/ScriptReference/Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.UnsafeUtility.html): "Unsafe utility class."

*Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.UnsafeUtility.cs* exposes functions to facilitate working with native memory. Here you'll find functions to call malloc and free, along with various utility functions such as memcpy. These functions can be called directly from user code.
