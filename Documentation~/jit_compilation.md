General computing term. JIT stands for "Just-in-time". 

> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation): "In computing, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, also known as dynamic translation, is a way of executing computer code that involves compilation during execution of a program – at run time – rather than prior to execution."
