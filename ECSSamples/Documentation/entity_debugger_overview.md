# Entity Debugger

The Entity Debugger allows you to look at currently running systems, filter entities by archetype and analyze how the entities are layed out within these archetypes.

Open the Entity Debugger using the Unity Editor **Window** > **Analysis** > **Entity Debugger** menu command.

## How to read the *Chunk Utilization* panel
Here's a breakdown of all the information available in the *Chunk utilization* panel.

1. **Number of entities** matched by the query used by the currently selected system. In this case *All Entities* is selected meaning we're visualizing all entities in the current world.
2. All this right panel is used to visualize **all the different archetypes matching the entities matched by the selection** on the left.
3. **Total number of chunks** used by these archetypes to store the data.
4. Detailed view of one archetype. The pills looking labels are the components composing the archetype.
5. **Number of chunks** used by this **archetype**.
6. Chunk utilization graph's Y axis: **number of chunks storing the X amount of entities**
   * The axis legend is also replicated on the right 
7. Chunk utilization graph's X axis: **number of entities stored in each Y chunk**
   * The max value of the X axis also shows the maximum count of entities that can fit in one chunk. In this case 54
8. The actual data points in the graph displayed as a bar chart.
   * In this case we see that this archetype is using 926 chunks total. 
   * The right orange bar shows that we have 924 chunks, each containing 54 entities.
   * The second very small bar (probably) shows that we have 2 chunks, each containing 52 entities.
