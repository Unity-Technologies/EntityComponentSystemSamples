// Mike's GDC Talk on 'A Data Oriented Approach to Using Component Systems'
// is a great reference for dissecting the Boids sample code:
// https://youtu.be/p65Yt20pw0g?t=1446
// It explains a slightly older implementation of this sample but almost all the
// information is still relevant.

// The targets (2 red fish) and obstacle (1 shark) move based on the ActorAnimation tab
// in the Unity UI, so that they are moving based on key-framed animation.
