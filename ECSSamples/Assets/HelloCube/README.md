# Entities Sample - HelloCube

These are 5 very brief samples demonstrating basic Entities API usage:

1. **MainThread**: A system rotates a single cube entity on the main thread.
2. **IJobEntity**: The cube is rotated by an IJobEntity.
3. **Aspects**: The cube is moved up and down using an aspect.
4. **Prefabs**: Multiple cubes are spawned from a prefab entity.
5. **IJobChunk**: The cube is rotated in an IJobChunk.
