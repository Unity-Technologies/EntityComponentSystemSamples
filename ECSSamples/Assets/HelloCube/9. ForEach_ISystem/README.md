# HelloCube: ForEach_ISystem

This sample demonstrates a simple ECS System that rotates a pair of cubes.
This sample is almost identical to the first one (1. ForEach), except that it demonstrates the functionality working inside of a struct-based system that implements the ISystem interface.  This allows for the entire system to be burst-compiled.

## What does it show?

This sample demonstrates the separation of data and functionality in ECS. Data is stored in components, while functionality is written into systems.

The **RotationSpeedSystem_ForEach_ISystem** *updates* the object's rotation using the *data* stored in the **RotationSpeed_ForEach_ISystem** Component.

## ISystem systems and Entities.ForEach

RotationSpeedSystem_ForEach_ISystem is a system that derives from ISystem and uses an Entities.ForEach lambda to iterate through the Entities. This example only creates a single Entity, but if you added more Entities to the scene, the RotationSpeedSystem_ForEach_ISystem updates them all â€” as long as they have a RotationSpeed_ForEach_ISystem Component (and the Rotation Component added when converting the GameObject's Transform to ECS Components).

Note that the system using Entities.ForEach uses ScheduleParallel to schedule the lambda to run on multiple worker threads if there are multiple chunks. This automatically takes advantage of multiple cores if they are available (and if your data spans multiple chunks).  Also, note that unlike the first ForEach sample, this system implements ISystem and can be entirely burst-compiled (with the `BurstCompileAttribute`).

## Converting from GameObject to Entity

This sample uses an automatically generated authoring component.  This MonoBehaviour is created via the **GenerateAuthoringComponent** attribute on the IComponentData and exposes all the public fields of that type for authoring.  See the **IJobChunk** sample for an example of how to write your own authoring component.
