### Known Issues

## [Samples Project for 0.10.0-preview] - 2021-12-31
### Changes
* Added `ImmediatePhysicsWorldStepper` utility class for running physics simulation immediately on the current thread.
* Changed `ProjectIntoFutureOnCueSystem` in Pool demo to use `ImmediatePhysicsWorldStepper`.
* Added Assets/Tests/MultipleWorlds/Animation/Animation scene that shows how you can use a separate `PhysicsWorld` to simulate a small number of non-critical bodies for animation purposes (character's ponytail and scabbard). `DriveAnimationBodySystem` syncs critical bodies between default and side physics world (character's head and torso) and prepares the data for non-critical bodies (position and velocity correction for ponytail and scabbard). `AnimationPhysicsSystem` performs single-threaded `PhysicsWorld` building, simulation and export to ECS components. The demo shows 2 variants of physically animated ponytail: with position and velocity corrections (green) and without them (blue).
* Added Assets/Tests/MultipleWorlds/ClientServer/ClientServer scene as a simplified client-server sample, with game-critical ghost bodies (exist on both server and client) and client-only bodies that are simulated only locally to add to game's visual appeal.
Bodies in server physics world are simulated first (would be predicted based on server data in real use-cases) and then mirrored into the default physics world. Default physics world contains ghost and client-only bodies, where ghost bodies are driven by their server counterparts (game objects are linked via Server Entity setting in Drive Ghost Body Authoring script). `DriveGhostBodySystem` drives ghost bodies by position or velocity, the ratio (position vs velocity) is determined by First Order Gain setting in Drive Ghost Body Authoring script on the client ghost body game object. `ServerPhysicsSystem` is the key system that builds, simulates and exports server physics world. 
The demo shows different kinematic bars (client-only, dynamic and kinematic ghost) rotating and pushing various speheres around (client-only, dynamic and kinematic ghosts driven by position, velocity and both equally).

## [Samples Project for 0.9.0-preview.4] - 2021-05-19
### Changes
* Dependencies
  * Updated Data Flow Graph to `0.21.0-preview.1`
  * Updated IDE Visual Studio to `2.0.7`
  * Updated Hybrid Renderer `0.13.0-preview.30`
### Fixes
### Known Issues

## [Samples Project for 0.8.0-preview] - 2021-03-26

### Changes
* Dependencies
  * Updated DOTS Editor from `0.13.0-preview` to `0.14.0-preview.1`
  * Updated Hybrid Renderer from `0.12.0-preview.42` to `0.13.0-preview.17`
  * Updated Burst from `1.4.4` to `1.5.0`

* Refactored the `CollisionEvent` and `TriggerEvent` demos to make the Stateful events clearer.
  * To add stateful events to your own project copy all scripts from the [Stateful](Assets/Demos/2.%20Setup/2d.%20Events/Scripts/Stateful) folder.
  * Then, if you want to have collision events:
    1. Use the **'Collide Raise Collision Events'** option of the **'Collision Response'** property of a `PhysicsShapeAuthoring` component, and
    2. Add a `StatefulCollisionEventBufferAuthoring` component to that entity (and select if details should be calculated or not)
    3. At runtime, read from the dynamic buffer of `StatefulCollisionEvent`s
  * Alternatively, if you want to have trigger events:
    1. Use the **'Raise Trigger Events'** option of the **'Collision Response'** property of a `PhysicsShapeAuthoring` component, and
    2. Add a `StatefulTriggerEventBufferAuthoring` component to that entity
    3. At runtime, read from the dynamic buffer of `StatefulTriggerEvent`s

## [Samples Project for 0.7.0-preview.3] - 2021-02-24

### Changes

* Dependencies
  * Updated Data Flow Graph from `0.18.0-preview.3` to `0.20.0-preview.4`
  * Updated DOTS Editor from `0.12.0-preview.4` to `0.13.0-preview`
  * Updated Hybrid Renderer from `0.10.0-preview.21` to `0.12.0-preview.42`
  * Updated Coding from `0.1.0-preview.17` to `0.1.0-preview.20`
  
* Added a new `MouseHoverAuthoring` script to help highlight the extra `CompoundCollider.Child.Entity` field and `PhysicsRenderEntity` component data. Check out the simple `1b. Representations` and more complex `2a2. Collider Parade - Advanced` demos scene for example of setup variations. 
* Added `Tests/VelocityClipping/VelocityClippingStacking` demo to showcase a simple replacement for the removed `SimulationCallbacks.Phase.PostSolveJacobians`. This demo does a really simple velocity clipping and the point is not to showcase stacking (which is covered with `Tests/Stacking` demos) but instead to show how to achieve the effect similar to previous callback without using the callback itself.
* Added `Tests/SystemScheduling/SchedulingSample` which shows how jobs that interact with physics runtime data (stored in PhysicsWorld) should be scheduled.

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug where duplicate joint Entities were created when multiple joint components are added to the same game object.

### Known Issues

## [Samples Project for 0.6.0-preview.3] - 2021-01-18

### Changes
* Dependencies
  * Updated Data Flow Graph from `0.18.0-preview.3` to `0.19.0-preview.5`

  * Updated Hybrid Renderer from `0.10.0-preview.21` to `0.11.0-preview.40`
* Added `5g. Change Collider Filter` sample showing explosion use case and the importance of collision filters in that case. Setting the force to 0 in `SpawnExplosionAuthoring` causes a performance spike because when the filters get set to default, a lot of bodies are pentetrating each other.

### Fixes

    * Added DOTS Editor `0.7.0-preview.1`
    * Hybrid Renderer from `0.4.0-preview.8` to `0.5.1-preview.18`
* The `PrismaticJoint` example no longer includes `MinDistanceFromAxis` or `MaxDistanceFromAxis` parameters.

* Added `5d. Kinematic Motion` to illustrate different ways of moving kinematic bodies.
* Improved usability of trigger events and collision events:
	* Events (StatefulTriggerEvent and StatefulCollisionEvent) have states indicating overlap or colliding state of two bodies:

		* Stay - the bodies did overlap or collide in the previous frame, and they do in the current frame
		* Exit - the bodies did overlap or collide in the previous frame, and they do not in the current frame
	* Events (StatefulTriggerEvent and StatefulCollisionEvent) are stored in DynamicBuffers of entities that raise them
	* Reworked following demos to demonstrate new trigger event approach:
		* `2d1a. Triggers - Change Material`
		* `2d1b. Triggers - Portals`
		* `2d1c. Triggers - Force Field`
	* `2d2a. Collision Events - Event States` added to demonstrate new collision event approach.

* CharacterController body is now using a `CollisionResponse.None` collision response on its body to avoid reporting duplicated collision/trigger events coming from the physics engine.
* `Demos/2. Setup/2b. Motion Properties/2b1. Motion Properties - Mass`, `Tests/Pyramids` and a group of demos under `Tests/Stacking` now showcase new solver stabilization features/strengths and weaknesses/trade-offs.

### Opening the Project with different Unity Editor versions

* To open the project with Unity `2019.3.0b1` or later, it is currently required to upgrade the following packages:
   - *Hybrid Renderer* (com.unity.rendering.hybrid) has to be upgraded to `0.1.1-preview`
   - *Lightweight RP* (com.unity.render-pipelines.lightweight) has to be updated to version `7.0.1`
   - A reimport of the materials might be required when this is done while the Unity Editor is opened.
